## About
 - The Duplicate Character Remover  allows the user to enter a string of characters and then removes duplicate characters from the string.

 - Screen 1 of the application displays an input field and a button with the text "Submit." The user can enter any value in the input field. When the user clicks the "Submit" button, the application redirects the user to screen 2.

- If the user enters an empty or space-only string, the application displays an alert message that prompts the user to enter a non-empty value. The application does not redirect the user to screen 2 in this scenario.

- Screen 2 of the application displays the input string as a series of cards, with each card representing a unique character in the string. Each card has a delete icon that allows the user to remove all instances of that character from the string.

- Cards for the same characters have the same background color. When all duplicate characters have been removed from the string, the application displays a success header. The application also displays the original string and the new string after duplicate characters have been removed.

- Screen 2 provides a back button that allows the user to return to screen 1. When the user goes back to screen 1, the input field is cleared/empty.
